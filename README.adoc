== OSGeo Glossary Database

This repository contains the latest snapshot of the glossary in YAML format.
The intended use is to serve as data backend for https://osgeo.geolexica.org/
and the https://github.com/geolexica/osgeo-glossarist[osgeo-glossarist] desktop app.

=== Migrating from legacy glossary sources

For data migration period, facilities to automatically populate the glossary
from legacy sources are included.

To rewrite YAML glossary with data migrated from those sources, run:

[source,sh]
----
make concepts
----

See https://github.com/geolexica/osgeo-termbase[osgeo-termbase] for migration logic implementation.
