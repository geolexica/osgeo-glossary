  definition: A tileindex is a Shapefile or other Vector data source that contains
    footprints of Raster data coverage. MapServer can use a tileindex to render a
    directory of raster data. The tileindex allows MapServer to only read the data
    that intersects the requested map extent, rather than reading all of the data.
