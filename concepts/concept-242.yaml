    The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API is the industry standard for
    database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and
    a wide range of databases – SQL databases and other tabular data sources,
    such as spreadsheets or flat files. The JDBC API provides a call-level API
    for SQL-based database access. JDBC technology allows you to use the Java
    programming language to exploit “Write Once, Run Anywhere” capabilities for
    applications that require access to enterprise data. With a JDBC
    technology-enabled driver, you can connect all corporate data even in a
    heterogeneous environment.
