    Geometry Engine Open Source is a C/C++ port of the Java Topology Suite. It
    is used for geometric algebra operations like determining if a polygon is
    contained in another polygon or determining the resultant intersection of
    two or more polygons. MapServer optionally uses GEOS for geometric algebra
    operations.
