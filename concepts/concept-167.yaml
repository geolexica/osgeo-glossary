  definition: "A single and specific metadata document, typically created in conformance
    with a metadata standard. There is typically a metadata instance for each geospatial
    dataset in a GIS. \n Example: If you had a GIS that managed road data and car
    accident data in ESRI Shapefiles, you would have a metadata instance for each
    shapefile. One metadata instance might be named roads_metadata.txt while the other
    was named car_accidents_metadata.txt."
