  definition:
  - content: "<geodesy> geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space
      formed by an ellipse that is rotated about a main axis"
  notes:
  - content: For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar
      axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located
      at the nominal centre of the Earth.
