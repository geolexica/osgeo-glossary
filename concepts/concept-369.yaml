  notes:
  - Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification
    schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in
    similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit,
    to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications.
