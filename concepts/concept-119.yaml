  definition: |-
    <geodesy> geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space formed by an ellipse that is rotated about a main axis

    Note 1 to entry: For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
