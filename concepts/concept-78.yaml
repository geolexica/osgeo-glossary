  definition: Geometric reference system used to numerically express the geodesic
    position of a point over the terrain. Each datum is defined according of an ellipsoid
    and a point where the ellipsoid and the Earth are tangent. In Spain for example,
    the datum uses the Hayford (or International 1924) ellipsoid and the tangency
    point is Postdam (Germany).
