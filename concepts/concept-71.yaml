  notes:
  - A dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint
    such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger
    dataset. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature
    attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart can be considered
    a dataset.;
