  definition: EPSG codes are numeric codes associated with coordinate system definitions.
    For instance, EPSG:4326 is geographic WGS84, and EPSG:32611 is “UTM zone 11 North,
    WGS84”. The WMS protocol uses EPSG codes to describe coordinate systems. EPSG
    codes are published by the OGP Surveying and Positioning Committee. A list of
    PROJ definitions corresponding to the EPSG codes can be found in the file /usr/local/share/proj/epsg.
    PROJECTION describes how to use these in your Mapfile.
