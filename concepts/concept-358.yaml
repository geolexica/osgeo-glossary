  - Geometric reference system used to numerically express the geodesic position of
    a point over the terrain. Each datum is defined according of an ellipsoid and
    a point where the ellipsoid and the Earth are tangent. In Spain for example, the
    datum uses the Hayford (or International 1924) ellipsoid and the tangency point
    is Postdam (Germany).
