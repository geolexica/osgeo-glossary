  definition: The Web Processing Service (WPS) specification from the Open Geospatial
    Consortium provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services. The Web Processing Service is designed to
    standardize the way that GIS calculations are made available to the Internet.
    WPS can describe any calculation (i.e. process) including all of its inputs and
    outputs, and trigger its execution as a Web Service.
