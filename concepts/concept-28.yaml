    designation: BMP
  definition:
  - content: uncompressed image format developed by Microsoft
  notes:
  - content: BMP is simple and pretty normalized; it is a excellent format for sharing
      data and fast when analyzing and processing images. However, since it is not
      compressed it does not improve the transmission and disk accessing times. BMP
      is often used with RGB 24 bits.
