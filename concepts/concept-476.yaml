  definition: Well-Known Text. This refers either to the text representation of geometries,
    with strings starting “POINT”, “LINESTRING”, “POLYGON”, and so on, or the text
    representation of a CRS, with strings starting “PROJCS”, “GEOGCS”, and so on.
    Well-known text representations are OGC standards, but do not have their own specification
    documents. The first descriptions of Well-Known Text (for geometries and for CRS)
    appeared in the SFSQL 1.0 specification. Often abbreviated as WKT.
