  term: Geoid
  definition: Is the level surface, equipotential in the gravitational field, which
    adopts an irregular threeÂ­dimensional spheroid. Due to the dependency on the mass
    distribution inside the Earth, it is impossible to represent it mathematically.
    The mathematical shape used to do it is the ellipsoid that approximately fits
    better the Earth shape. The geoid is coincident with the mean ocean surface when
    they are quiet, virtually extended for the continents land.
