    identifiable collection of data

    Note 1 to entry:  A dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset.;
