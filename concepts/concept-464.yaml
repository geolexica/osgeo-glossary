    The Web Map Service (WMS) specification from the Open Geospatial Consortium
    defines an interface for requesting rendered map images across the web. The
    Web Map Service is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images
    over the Internet that are generated by a map server using data from a GIS
    database. The specification was developed and first published by the Open
    Geospatial Consortium in 1999.
