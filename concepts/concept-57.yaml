  definition: |
    coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum

    Note 1 to entry: Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames.

    Note 2 to entry: For geodetic and vertical reference frames, the object will be the Earth. In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.

  - Coordinate reference system. The combination of a geographic and projected coordinate
    systems that define how two-dimensional maps relate to locations on the earth’s
    surface. Geographic coordinate systems use a three-dimensional spherical surface
    to define those locations, referencing points on that surface through angles (latitude
    and longitude values) measured from the earth’s center. Projected coordinate systems
    are based on flat two-dimensional surfaces, with locations referenced by x, y
    coordinates measured as constant lengths and distances across that surface. See
    also SRID and SRS.
